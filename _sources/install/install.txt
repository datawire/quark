Installation
============

This document walks you through the system, application, and tooling requirements for using Quark as well as the actual installation process. 

Prerequisites
-------------

Quark has basic requirements that all users must meet as well as
requirements specific to particular output languages.

Basic Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Quark requires a modern Linux distribution or Mac OS X. It has been successfully tested on the following:

* Mac OS 10.10 (Yosemite)
* Mac OS 10.11 (El Capitain)
* Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty)
* Fedora 22

Quark also requires the following:

* Python 2.7+

Java Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must have Java installed to use any Java code generated by Quark. Quark has been successfully tested with Java 7 and Java 8.

To compile and run the generated code directly from Quark you must also have Maven installed. Quark has been successfully tested with Maven 3.1 and Maven 3.3.x. Maven is not required if you wish to use the generated .java files manually either directly or within an IDE.

To use the documentation or package generation feature of Quark with Java, you must also have Maven installed. Quark has been successfully tested with Maven 3.1 and Maven 3.3.x.

Note: Javadoc comments will be generated in the source files as part of the code generation process. You may manually run Javadoc on those files to generate HTML documentation without Maven installed.

Python Requirements
