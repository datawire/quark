# Quark

Quark lets you define and implement rich (micro)service APIs that work with your existing application frameworks and protocols. Quark lets you:

* Easily define RPC or event based APIs on top of existing REST or
  websocket protocols
* Build service APIs with rich protocol semantics
* Support multiple programming languages and application frameworks

## Getting Started

To get started, install Datawire Connect:

        pip install datawire-quark

## Examples

Check out the examples in the [Quark Examples repository](https://github.com/datawire/quark/tree/0.2.x/examples):

        git clone git@github.com:datawire/quark.git
        cd quark/examples

## Next Steps

The [Quark Quick Start](http://datawire.github.io/quark/0.2/quick-start/index.html) provides an overview of the basic installation requirements and process, basic compile commands, and the Quark language. If you have successfully run any of the examples linked above, you can probably skip this book.
